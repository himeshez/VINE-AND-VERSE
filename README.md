## Music Player Details 
- The Music Player isn't API based, therefore you will need to either manually add the songs (a folder) in your project directory or use .mp3 links.
- You will need to host your project on a server (when locally stored), like Wamp Server because, for security reasons, your browser wouldn't access your local files.
- The webpage isn't responsive, meaning that it will not automatically resize itself according to the device you are using, in conclusion, looking at the final product on desktop will be different from looking at in on mobile phone.

## Tech Stack 
- JavaScript (For Logic & interactivity and some jQuery too)
- HTML (For Structure)
- CSS (For Design and animation)
- Wamp (For initial LocalHost run)
- Canva (Embed Live Option)
